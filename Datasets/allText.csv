1253,Can Peter start to draft an override letter?,False
1254,My schedule melted down after we talked on Monday.,False
1255,Heres where folks came out.,False
1256,Theres some concern about size.,False
1257,"Were supposed to be no larger than 3, but we lobbied Aceves and he apparently Okd our oversized group.",False
1258,Folks wondered if there were other groups that are smaller than ours that you could hook up with.,False
1259,Sorry about that its a wrinkle that I didnt think about when we spoke.,False

1263,We did part of the work last week.,False
1264,"I am on vacation next week, so here are my current thoughts.",False
1265,I am contactable on my mobile if necessary.,False
1266,"Strictly speaking, we are still over our UK power limit, but the limit was set when we were assuming no gas power correlation and therefore a higher portfolio VAR.",False
1267,"Also, if I understand your mail correctly, Matrix 1 implies 55 gas power correlation is consistent with our correlation curves, and this reduces total VAR by o1.8mm.",False
1268,EFA slot correlations The issue of whether our existing EFA to EFA correlation matrix is correct is a separate issue.,False
1269,"Our original matrix was based on historicals, but the analysis is worth doing again.",False
1270,Your matrix 2 results certainly indicate how important these correlations are.,False
1271,"We are still reviewing the shape of the long term curve, and Id like to wait until both Simon Hastings and I are back in the office (Monday week) before finalising this.",False
1272,"First, if VAR is calculated accurately the correlation between Power and Gas curves should not affect VAR number for Power and VAR number for Gas, only the aggregate number will be affected.",False
1273,"The changes you see are due to the fact that we use Monte Carlo simulation method, which accuracy depends on the number of simulations.",False
1274,I calculated weighted correlations based on 2 curves I got from Paul.,False
1275,"As the weights along the term structure I used the product of price, position and volatility for each time bucket for Gas and each of EFA slots.",False
1276,"The results are shown below Inserting these numbers into the original correlation matrix produced negatively definite correlation matrix, which brakes VAR engine.",False
1277,"Correlation matrix for any set of random variables is non negative by definition, and remains non negatively definite if calculated properly based on any historical data.",False
1278,"Here, according to our phone discussion, we started experimenting with correlations, assuming the same correlation for each EFA slot and ET Elec versus Gas.",False
1279,I am sending you the spreadsheet which summaries the results.,False
1280,In Matrix 1 the correlations across EFA slots are identical to these in original matrix.,False
1281,I obtained this matrix by trial and error.,False
1282,"Matrix 2 is produces by Naveen using Fingers algorithm, it differs from original matrix across EFA slots as well as in Power versus Gas correlations and gives higher VAR than matrix 1 does.",False
1283,Concluding we will look at the historical forward prices and try to calculate historical correlations from them.,False
1284,Interesting to note that for a higher correlation of 0.2 the power VaR increases which is counter to intuition.,False
1285,This implies that we need to look into how the correlations are being applied within the model.,False
1286,"Once we can derive single correlations from the term structure, is the next action to understand how they are being applied and whether the model captures the PL volatility in the spread option deals.",False
1287,From 0.4 onwards the VaR calculation failed.,False
1288,I certainly agree on the tip of the iceberg point.,False
1289,They do need to be watched and watched carefully.,False
